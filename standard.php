              The XL BULLY is an American bully that is over 19" if female and over 20" if male.

                We are excited to have separated the XL from the pocket and standard American Bully classes.  We have an XL BULLY standard in the works, as we feel these dogs carry a different breed type  and genetic makeup than the pocket and standard varieties, as the standard will reflect.  Stay tuned for more info on this breed.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">FRENCH BULLDOG</h3>
            <p class="text-[#CCCCCC] mb-4">
              The French Bulldog resembles a bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect “bat ears” that are the breed’s trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.

                The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don’t bark much—but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety.
