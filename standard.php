        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">General Overview</h4>
        <p>
          The Exotic Bully is a medium-sized, compact dog with a smooth, short coat and a dense, muscular frame. Its tightly fitted skin covers a heavily boned body, creating a bold and solid appearance. Key features include a broad chest, defined muscle tone in the shoulders and rear, a blocky head, pronounced cheeks, and deep indentations beneath the eyes. With its powerful stance and intense expression, the Exotic Bully makes a strong visual impression. Despite its rugged build, the breed is affectionate, calm, and highly family-oriented. Exotic Bullies are gentle with children, small animals, and other dogs. Aggression, fearfulness, or shyness is considered highly undesirable and not typical of the breed.

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Head & Face</h4>
        <p>
          The head is broad and well-developed, consistent with the dog's overall proportions. The skull is pronounced, with a well-defined stop creating a near 90-degree angle with the muzzle. The muzzle is wide, short, and square, extending straight out from the face and appearing flat or slightly upturned when viewed from the side. Curved muzzles are discouraged. The muzzle should be no longer than one-fourth the length of the skull. A well-structured jaw and prominent cheeks enhance the dog's expression, along with deep, V-shaped indentations beneath each eye.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Ears</h4>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Eyes</h4>
        <p>
          Eyes should be oval in shape, set low and wide apart. Round or protruding eyes are discouraged. All colors are allowed, except pink, red, or signs of albinism. While blue eyes are permitted, they are not preferred. Different-colored eyes are considered a fault.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Bite</h4>
        <p>Either an undershot or scissor bite is allowed, but the undershot must not exceed 1/4 inch.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Neck</h4>
        <p>The neck should be thick, arched, muscular, and short in length, transitioning smoothly into the shoulders.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Forequarters</h4>
        <p>Shoulders should be muscular and well-defined. Front legs are short and sturdy, with a slight outward curve when viewed from the front. Pasterns should remain upright, with feet facing forward. Feet must be tight, arched (knuckled up), and appropriately sized for the dog's frame.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Body</h4>
        <p>The body is dense and muscular, featuring a wide chest that drops to at least elbow level and a rounded rib cage. The topline is either level or slopes gently downward from withers to rump. While the dog may look square overall, the back should be slightly longer than the height from the ground to the withers.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Hindquarters</h4>
        <p>The rear is muscular, equal in width to the shoulders, and should not turn inward or outward. The croup has a light downward slope toward a low-set tail. Stifle angulation is moderate.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Tail</h4>
        <p>The tail should be low-set, straight, and free from kinks or knots, tapering to a fine tip and reaching to the hock. Curled, docked, or screw tails are faults.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Coat</h4>
        <p>The coat is short, tight-fitting, and glossy. All hair should be under Â½ inch in length.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 class="text-xl text-[#FFD700] font-semibold uppercase mb-2">Movement</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the breed's muscular and compact build, movement is limited and efficient. The Exotic Bully typically moves with short, quick strides, with rear feet skimming the ground. This breed is not designed for endurance but thrives in short bursts of activity.
